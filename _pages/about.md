I am currently pursuing a PhD degree (after two years) in the [Institute of Information Engineering](http://www.iie.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) in 2018.  Up to now, I have published several papers in the top conferences (e.g., ACL, EMNLP, etc.), and won prides in CCKS completitions . 

My main research interests include event extraction, information extraction and knowledge acquisition.
