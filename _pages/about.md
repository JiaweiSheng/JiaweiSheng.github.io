<!-- I am currently pursuing a PhD degree (the 4/5 year) in the [Institute of Information Engineering](http://www.iie.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). 
I received my Bachelor’s degree from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) in 2018.  Up to now, I have published several papers in the top conferences (e.g., ACL, SIGIR, EMNLP, etc.), and won prizes in data competitions. 
My main research interests include **event extraction**, **information extraction** and **knowledge graph completion.**
Now, I am preparing for NLP algorithm engineer recruit.  -->

I am now a Tenure-track Associate Professor at [Institute of Information Engineering](http://www.iie.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/).
Before that, I received the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2023, and received the Bachelor’s degree from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/) in 2018. I have published 20+ top conference/journel papers, and undertaked multiple important projects.
My main research interests include **knowledge fusion & reasoning**, **knowledge acquisition** and **LLM application**.
